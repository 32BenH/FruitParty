      <h1 class="display-3">Inspiration Behind the Idea</h1>
      <p class="lead">Bananalyzer is a web-based application that uses image processing to help customers select optimal produce when at the grocery store. 
          The idea revolves around informing shoppers on the status of the produce they are selecting. When customers scan the produce with their phone, 
          data such as days remaining until ripe and days until bad are provided.</p>

                    This was my first Hackathon and I was involved in web development as well as coming up with the idea.
                    While thinking about problems in the grocery store I thought about how I have trouble knowing if produce is good and 
                    how long it will last. A person on our team excels in image processing so we came up with the idea of analyzing fruit
                    with your phone camera and giving data to the consumer on various aspects of the fruit. 
                    During the event, learning some web development was new for me and a welcome challenge.</p>

            <p class="card-text">I am a fourth year computer engineering student at the University of Cincinnati. 
                This was my first Hackathon experience. I helped with the web and app development. Web development was very
                new to me so this has been a fun experience to work on something that I had no knowledge on. I have created a few
                small apps before so that was familiar territory. Solving this problem touches on whenever going to a grocery store
                it is always hard to tell if a fruit is ripe or not. We created a image analysis website/app that helps the user tell
                if the fruit is ripe as long with some other small things about the fruit.</p>

            <p class="card-text">I am a fourth year computer engineering student at the University of Cincinnati. 
                This was my second Hackathon. I was mostly involved with the web development as well as having some input in the design. 
                I had limited experience with web development coming in, having done a couple tutorials of HTML/CSS in my free time. 
                However, I had never used Bootstrap or jQuery. It was a great learning experience to be able to start from scratch and be 
                able to produce a fully functioning website. I love the freedom that you are given when designing, it gives you so many different
                ways that you can take the application. </p>
