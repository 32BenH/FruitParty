      <h1 class="display-3">Inspiration Behind the Idea</h1>
      <p class="lead">Bananalyzer is a web-based application that uses image processing to help customers select optimal produce when at the grocery store. 
          The idea revolves around informing shoppers on the status of the produce they are selecting. When customers scan the produce with their phone, 
          data such as days remaining until ripe and days until bad are provided.</p>

                <p class="card-text">I am a fourth year electrical engineering student at the University of Cincinnati. 
                    This was my first Hackathon and I was involved in web development as well as coming up with the idea.
                    While thinking about problems in the grocery store I thought about how I have trouble knowing if produce is good and 
                    how long it will last. A person on our team excels in image processing so we came up with the idea of analyzing fruit
                    with your phone camera and giving data to the consumer on various aspects of the fruit. 
                    During the event, learning some web development was new for me and a welcome challenge.</p>
